# Medium Challenge: Fibonacci Sequence

## Problem Statement
Write a function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers.

## Input
* An integer `n` (1 <= n <= 30).

## Output
* Return the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Example
Input: `n = 5`
Output: `3`
