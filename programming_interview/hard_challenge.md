# Hard Challenge: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Description
Given a string `s`, write a function `length_of_longest_substring` that returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Input
A string `s` where 1 <= len(s) <= 5 * 10^4 and `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

## Output
Return an integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Example
For `s = "abcabcbb"`, the function should return `3` because the answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Note:** Write your solution in `solution.py`.
