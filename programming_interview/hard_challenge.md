# Hard Challenge: Longest Palindromic Substring

## Problem Statement
Write a function `longest_palindromic_substring(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

A palindromic string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

## Input
* A string `s` (1 <= s.length <= 1000).

## Output
* Return the longest palindromic substring in `s`. If there is more than one such substring, return any of them.

## Example
Input: `s = "babad"`
Output: `"bab"`

Please write your solution in a file named `solution.py` in the same directory.
