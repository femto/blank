## Programming Interview Challenges

This repository contains a directory named `programming_interview` which is dedicated to programming interview challenges. It includes three levels of challenges: easy, medium, and hard. Each challenge comes with a description and a Python test file to verify the correctness of your solution. You should write your solution in a file named `solution.py` in the same directory.
